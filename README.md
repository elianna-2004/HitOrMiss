Description: 
The Number Verification Website Application is a full-stack web application designed to validate phone numbers in real time by integrating a third-party phone verification API. The application processes structured API responses to determine number validity, line type (mobile, VoIP, or landline), and geographic metadata, presenting results through a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface. This project simulates real-world use cases commonly found in e-commerce platforms, authentication systems, and fraud-prevention workflows where accurate phone number validation is critical.

The application was built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+), with a strong emphasis on frontend-backend communication, asynchronous programming, and RESTful API integration. API requests are handled using modern asynchronous techniques such as fetch and async/await, with structured JSON parsing, data validation, and error handling to ensure reliability and performance. Special attention was given to input sanitization, edge-case handling, and graceful failure states to enhance usability and system robustness.

Throughout development, significant focus was placed on debugging, performance optimization, and UI/UX refinement. Browser developer tools were used to diagnose network issues, resolve MIME-type errors, and improve rendering performance. Version control was managed using Git and GitHub, enabling clean code iteration, change tracking, and maintainable development workflows. Overall, this project demonstrates strong skills in web development, API integration, data processing, asynchronous programming, and problem-solving, showcasing the ability to build production-style applications that leverage external services to deliver meaningful, real-time insights to users.
